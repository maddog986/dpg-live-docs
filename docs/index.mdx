# What is DPG Live Docs?

Live Docs is a ready-to-use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) theme to create a documentation website like this one. What this documentation is best for is for documentation for a react project where you would want to document modules and be able to view/edit them live within the documentation platform.

## Why was it created?

As the maintainer of many private libraries, I have to develop numerous modules that may or may not get used. However I also found I spent more time searching through various projects to find something I already created. I wanted a documentation where I could save and document vary modules.

### What System is this site using?

While searching around for other open source documentation, I found one close, called [Next Smooth Docs](https://github.com/lwz7512/next-smooth-doc) but found it was not really flexible enough for me. Since I'm getting fimilar with NextJs for a possible WordPress replacement, I figured I would just code my own.
So after a bit of coding, and a few dedicated days of programming and learning the NextJS system, DPG Live Docs was born.

### What are the differences with other documentation generators?

Live Docs provides an easier method of documenting React code, while not having to dedicate a bunch of time digging through code to get it working right with very little minimal configuration.

It includes many features:

- Full theme customization designed with [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [MDX Support](https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown)
- [React Live Editor](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) and [Code Highliter](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) that supports js, jsx, json, and more.
- [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for page content.
- Table of contents based on the page structure (h1, h2, h3, h4 tags).
- Menu structure is dynamiclly driven based of mdx file structure.
