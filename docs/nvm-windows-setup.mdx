# Install NVM On Windows

When I began developing Node.js I started off following the “readme” and documentations that simply stated to install Node.js for Windows. However, over time I have found out the hard way many different packages and projects require very specific versions of Node.js.

NVM for Windows helps to solve this issue of needing to change versions of Node by allowing you to “hot load” different versions.

## Pre-Install Notice

Uninstall Node.js completely before setting up NVM.

If you already have Node.js installed, you will have to completely uninstall it. I have also found first hand that after uninstalling NPM it leaves folders behind that have to be manually deleted. I skipped this at first, and could never get NVM working until I deleted all 3 folders:

- %appdata%\npm
- %appdata%\npm-cache
- %programfiles%\nodejs

NVM uses generated symlink to swap versions. So if you do not remove the folders prior to install, it wont work.

## Install NVM

Install the latest version of [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) from the official releases page.
*Note: I first tried the Chocolatey installer and could not get it working correctly.*

## Install Node using NVM

Once NVM is installed you will need to install at least one version of Node. Running the command “nvm list available” will give you a complete list of all Node versions you can install.
*You may have to run an elevated permissions window for commands to work.*

```bash
nvm list available
```

Choose a Node.js version to install, or choose latest, and run the command to install it:

```bash
nvm install latest
```

## Check what version of Node is running

Simply run the command to see what version of Node is currently selected.

```bash
node -v
```
